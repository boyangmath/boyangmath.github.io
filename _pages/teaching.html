<p>Fall 2020-2024: Complex Analysis (a graduate course)</p>

       <p>It is primarily a qualifying-level course for first year graduate students. We also include some advanced topics 
              if time permits. <br>
       The topics are changed year by year, accmulatively it covers<br>

            (1) Estimates and constructions of holomorphic function, such as Hadamard, Jensen, Weierstrass, Mittag-Leffler, and else.<br>

            (2) Special functions, including Gamma and zeta. <br>

            (3) Proof of Riemann Mapping Theorem.<br>

            (4) Examples of conformal mappings, including Schwarz-Christoffel formula and hypergeometric functions.<br>

            (5) Ahlfors-Schwarz lemma and its application to Picard's theorems.<br>

            (6) The d-bar equation in complex dimesion one.<br>

            (7) Elementary aspects on holomorphic functions of several complex variables.<br>

       Lecture notes are under constant revision, and hopefully will be posted soon.

<p>Spring 2023: Complex manifolds</p>

       <p>It is a graduate topic course on complex differential geometry. <br>
          Our goal was to cover first two chapters of Székelyhidi's book "An introduction to extremal Kähler metrics". Click 
              <a href="/assets/pdf/cm_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for the course 
         calendar and HW assignments.
       </p>

<p>Spring 2018-2023, 2026: Complex Analysis (an undergraduate course)</p>

       <p>It is for second year math majors.<br> 
              
              It covers elementary complex analysis of a single complex variable.<br> 
              
              (1) The main textbook is Jiarong Yu's textbook in Chinese (in the spirit of first three chapters of Cartan's "Elementary theory of analytic functions of one or several complex variables").<br> 
              
              (2) We also refer to first three chapters of Stein-Shakarichi. <br>
              
              (3) If time permits, we discuss some supplementary topics, for example Lee-Yang's theorem on zeros.
     </p>


<p>Fall 2018-2019: Diferential geometry (an undergraduate course) </p>

       <p>It is for junior math majors.<br> 
              It covers elementary theory of curves and surfaces in 3-dim Euclidean spaces. We use Klingenberg's "Differential geometry" as the textbook.
              <br> 
        </p>
<p>Spring 2024-2026: Linear algebra </p>

<p>Spring 2025: Multivariable Calculus</p>

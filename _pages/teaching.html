<p>Fall 2020-2004: Complex Analysis (a graduate course)</p>

       It is a qualilyfing-level course for first year graduate students. The topics are changed year by year, accmulatively it covers:

            (1) Estimates and constructions of holomorphic function, such as Hadamard, Jensen, Weierstrass, Mittag-Leffler, and else.

            (2) Special functions, including Gamma and zeta. 

            (3) Proof of Riemann Mapping Theorem.

            (4) Examples of conformal mappings, including Schwarz-Christoffel formula and hypergeometric functions.

            (5) Ahlfors-Schwarz lemma and its application to Picard's theorems.

            (6) d-bar equations in complex dimesion one.

       Lecture notes are under constant revision, and hopefully will be posted soon.

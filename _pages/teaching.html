<p>Fall 2020-2004: Complex Analysis (a graduate course)</p>

       <p>It is a qualilyfing-level course for first year graduate students. <br>
       The topics are changed year by year, accmulatively it covers<br>

            (1) Estimates and constructions of holomorphic function, such as Hadamard, Jensen, Weierstrass, Mittag-Leffler, and else.<br>

            (2) Special functions, including Gamma and zeta. <br>

            (3) Proof of Riemann Mapping Theorem.<br>

            (4) Examples of conformal mappings, including Schwarz-Christoffel formula and hypergeometric functions.<br>

            (5) Ahlfors-Schwarz lemma and its application to Picard's theorems.<br>

            (6) d-bar equations in complex dimesion one.<br>

       Lecture notes are under constant revision, and hopefully will be posted soon.
